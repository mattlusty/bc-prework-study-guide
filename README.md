# prework-study-guide

## Description

I wanted to create the world's greatest web app that would revolutionise the way students study! This app is built to streamline front-end topic study and accelerate the learning experience! Just think of as many problems you can fit in your head. It probably solves 99.999% of all world problems! From students not remembering a few minimally detailed points on deep and complex problems, to simply not knowing which topic they should be studying next. Introducing Prework-Study-Guide! Now these first-world problems, have first-class solutions!

I learned why Git is called as it is. I learned what SSH keys are and how to setup this authentication method for connecting to Git remotes. I learned that pull is merely the process of a fetch and merge in one, and that it always merges the specified remote branch into the current checked out branch. And that if these branches have diverged, we are required to explicitly choose the merge strategy by setting a git configuration. I learned that HTML is the structure of webpages, CSS the styling, and Javascript provides intelligent interaction between all plus the user.

## Usage

A bootcamp student simply needs to go to the Prework-Study-Guide webpage and they can instantaneously see lists of study notes underneath headings of the 4 primary front-end topics, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Git!

Complete with console information prompts, the user simply needs to right click anywhere on the webpage and select "Inspect". The browser console will explain all and suggest to the user which topic to study next!
